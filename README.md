# Integrating multi-OMICS data through sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for the prediction of complex traits: A comparison study

This repository presents the code of the methods, simulation studies and data analyses performe in the bioRxiv preprint "Integrating multi-OMICS data through sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for the prediction of complex traits: A comparison study", by T. Rodosthenous, V. Shahrezaei and M. Evangelou.

## (A) sCCA Functions:
- ConvCCA on LASSO and SCAD penalties, for two or more input datasets 
- RelPMDCCA on LASSO and SCAD penalties, for two or more input datasets
- Function in obtaining additional canonical pairs

## (B) Simulation Analysis
- Data generating models
- Performance assessment

## (C) Data Analysis
- nutriMouse 
  - Data are found under the R package "whitening", by running data("nutrimouse")
- cancerTypes
  - Data are found in the following link: http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/SNF/SNF/Software.html
